# gameTest
for one it is not a game
it is closer to a deminstration of what happends if a high school student trys to program something with a language they don't know all to well.

while the code works you will be hard pressed to make sense of the comments.
I did not make a long term plan for this so the entire read slide code is a mess.
I was going to do a file parser but i was pressed for time.
good luck understanding this
