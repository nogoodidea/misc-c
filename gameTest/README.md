# gameTest
For one it is not a game.

It is closer to a deminstration of what happends if a high school student trys to program something with a language they don't know all to well.

While the code works you will be hard pressed too make sense of the comments.

I did not make a long term plan for this so the entire read slide code is a mess.

I was going to do a file parser but i was pressed for time.

Good luck understanding this.
